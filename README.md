<h2>Fluency-Predictor</h2>

<p>This web app uses Speech-to-Text technology recorded in the web browser to complete linguistic analysis, using an offline Vosk model to do so. <br>
A custom pdf (using fpdf) can be "purchased" using Stripe Checkout. Libraries used for linguistic analysis include: grammarbot, myprosody, and fastpunct.</p>
<br>

<p>I started this project back in August 2021 (before I knew how to even use the git command line lol), but I thought it was time to upload it to remind me to keep working on it.</p>
